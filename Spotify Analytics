-- For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
-- Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
-- Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

-- Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata
(id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL)

-- Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

-- Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.

-- What is the average danceability by artist and track?
SELECT DISTINCT(artist_name), track_name, AVG(danceability) AS average_danceability
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

-- Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?
SELECT DISTINCT(artist_name), popularity
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- What artist released the longest song?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, duration_ms
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?
SELECT AVG(danceability) AS average_danceability
FROM (
    SELECT danceability
    FROM Spotifydata
    ORDER BY popularity DESC
    LIMIT 10
) AS top_10_songs;

-- Which artist has the highest energy?
SELECT artist_name, energy
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY energy DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- What is the average tempo for each artist with more than one song?
SELECT artist_name, AVG(tempo) AS avg_tempo
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING COUNT(track_name) >= 1;

-- Find all tracks with above-average danceability.
SELECT track_name, danceability
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE danceability > (
    SELECT AVG(danceability)
    FROM Spotifydata
);
